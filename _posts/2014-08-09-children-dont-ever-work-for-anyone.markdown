As young as we are, we're already employees.

I could say that I’m from the middle class in my country, the Philippines. I went to good schools for my grade school, high school and collegiate years; though I’m just at the mid of my college years. Back in grade school, I studied in a private school, which was the sort of school where the “elite” (if I may) enroll their children in. I got to rub shoulders with some rich, spoiled kids who, from the looks of it, haven’t changed much since then. High school was different from my grade school since my erstwhile high school was a science high school. Science high schools are known to be hard to get in to since they are like mini-colleges; there’s an entrance exam that you have to answer and (in my school, at least) only the top 250 applicants are accepted. You see, science high schools are picky with who they let in the school due to the different benefits each student receives when they get accepted: completely free tuition fees, stipend every month, free uniforms, free books, notebooks, pens, and scratch pads. Since the education is free, and the benefits are spot-on, I got to meet some of the not really well-off people in the city I reside in (they are the nicest and smartest people you will ever meet!) From rich grade school classmates to people who lived simply, I think I’ve gone through the whole spectrum of classmates that you can meet. Now, college seems a lot like my high school; it’s a mix between well-off people and people who are living on sustenance.

The common thing with these three levels of learning is that each time I ask, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” I’d get a myriad of cliché answers:

“Oh, I want to be a lawyer.”
“I’d like to become a doctor, like a surgeon of something.”
“Get a nice job as a manager.”
This, in my opinion, is what’s wrong with the education system (in my country at least). We’re all taught to be mindless followers of a system that molds us into these employees. As young as we are, we’re already employees. We all have this mentality that keeps us at an employee level. Don’t question authority, follow the rules, and keep your lines straight!

Sometimes though, when I ask people the question that makes them decide their future, I get some, albeit a few, answers that spark me:

“I’m going to open up my own advertising agency.”
“Take over the family business.”
“Found a start-up.”
These are the answers I’m looking for. I was raised in a household where my sister and I were taught to not be employees; to never work for anyone. Yes, it sounds like a daunting task; not working for anyone, ever. I’d have to agree with that. Although sometimes, just the idea of not being an employee is what you need, even if you’re an employee yourself (!).

Being raised in a household where I was told to never work for anyone, I got used to thinking that I should found my own start-up/company. It’s a heavy idea, actually. Most teens these days have a predefined path in life: go to school, graduate, get a steady job, probably get a loan or a financing plan or two, get married, pay of loans and financing plans, retire, and die. I admit, this isn’t such a bad plan. It’s tried and tested, we all know it works. Our parents did it, and their parents did it, too. Why shouldn’t we? This is precisely what having an employee mindset is about; following norms and not rising to what you are really capable of. It seems like the task of putting up a company fresh out of school is impossible. There are these problems like, “Where am I going to get the capital?” or, “My business might fail.” All these problems are real and you will face them sometime in the future. How can you stop these problems from coming up? Start early.

Back in high school, I got into the start-up scene around Metro Manila. It was a beautiful, fast, and intricate network of talks, hackathons, meetups, and contests. There were so many buzzwords going around like, “Incubator”, “VC”, “Minimum Viable Product”, and all the other jargon people would talk about at different events. This really got me hooked; I knew that I wanted to found my own startup since then. Back in 2012, I opened a startup with my father. It was a good 1 year, we were making a few sales here and there. By the second year, we evaporated. Our CMO left, along with our CTO. Our investors started pulling out. We were done. We were through. We failed.

I don’t look at this in a negative way, though. I think it’s a great reminder to me (and my father) of what it feels like to be founding/part of a startup: it’s scary and it will bite you in the ass. These harsh realities shouldn’t scare an aspiring entrepreneur out of founding a business, especially when you’re young. Our parents will say, “You have your life ahead of you,” so if you fail now, at a young age, you have time to recover; faster than a mid-20 year old or even a middle aged man that has just started. If you fail now, at such a ripe age before/during college, you won’t be hit as hard compared to when you start a few years after you get your college degree.

What’s great about founding a startup in college is that you have a large pool of people to help you. “No matter how hard you try, you can’t do it all.” Any startup needs a good team. You can have the most amazing product but if you have a lousy team then it’s down the drain. Being in college would let you vet your peers. You can see who has the same mindset as you do; entrepreneurial and hungry for success. Who knows, you might even entice someone to found something with you, that person planning to become some programmer at a software company now turned entrepreneur.

As for me, I’m out of college right now; which is supposedly my 2nd year. I go to hackathons, do some freelance work and I muster a few startup ideas myself. Who knows, if I could just get the right team, a good idea, and a tad bit of luck, I could make it. I sure as hell won’t start after college.

I wrote this for students, drop outs and anyone who’s aspiring to be an entrepreneur. I hope you all succeed.
